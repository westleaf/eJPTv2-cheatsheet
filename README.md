# My ejpt v2 cheat sheets
This repo contains almost every command I ever ran during the PTS course.

## Will this prep me for the exam?
It will not. But the videos and labs will. The thing I would recommend doing in order to enhance your chances on the exam is just study the step-by-step instructions where the instructor is lacking.

## Got some feedback or is there any typos?
Get in touch with me at exec@westy.sh

## Disclamer
Don't use anything here without the proper authorization. There is no cheat sheet in prison.
