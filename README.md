# My ejpt v2 cheat sheets
This repo contains almost every command I ever ran during the PTS course, nothing here is from my exam notes.

## Will this prep me for the exam?
It will not, but the videos and labs will. The thing I would recommend doing in order to increase your chances on the exam is just study the topics on THM or something similar. I managed to get a 97% on the exam with no prior experience and I studied around 2-4h per day.

## Disclamer
Don't use anything here without the proper authorization. There is no cheat sheet in prison.
